<h1>Bobs-only Stedman Triples made easy</h1>

On Sunday 11th June 1995 a <a
href="https://www.cugcr.org.uk">Cambridge University Guild</a>
band rang a <a
href="http://saddleton.org.uk/cugcr/notable.htm#1645">
peal of Stedman Triples</a> at Cholsey using a ten-part
composition with 438 bobs and no singles. This provided an answer
to the <a
href="https://www.ringingworld.co.uk/news-articles/obituaries/1380-roger-bailey.html">
Chairman of the Peal Compositions Committee</a> who after the first bobs-only peal of Stedman
Triples said "Now we just want a bobs-only peal that a mortal can
call!" The <a
href="http://saddleton.org.uk/cugcr/notable.htm#1634">
first bobs-only peal</a> was also rung by a Cambridge University
Guild band, at <a
href="https://stjohnswaterloo.org/">
St. John's, Waterloo Road</a> on 22nd January 1995. The
    <a href="https://complib.org/composition/10423">composition</a>, by Philip Saddleton and Andrew Johnson, had 579 bobs
in one part. Colin Wyld's compositions, composed first but only
    published after the Waterloo Road peal was rung, had <a href="https://complib.org/composition/21261">705</a> and <a href="https://complib.org/composition/37681">597</a>
bobs. 

<p>The latest <a href="#composition">composition</a> is in 10
parts, based on block <tt><a href="#blockB">B</a></tt>
illustrated below. The part-ends are rotations and reversals of
rounds on 5 with 67 behind, so are easy to spot, especially as
there is always a bob on 67 just before the part-end, and all the
reversals come first, then all the rotations of rounds. As 6 and
7 are fixed at the part-ends the conductor has a choice of easier
bells to call the composition from, rather like 7 or 8 in
Major.</p>

<p>The other parts are minor variations of block <tt><a href="#blockB">B</a></tt>.
Block <tt><a href="#blockD">D</a></tt> is block <tt><a href="#blockB">B</a></tt> with a
course <a href="#repeat">repeated</a>. The remaining parts are
block <tt><a href="#blockB">B</a></tt> with this course removed and replaced by 1, 3 or
9 bobs with 76 behind. Block <tt><a href="#blockE">E</a></tt> is
identified for use in quarter peals (<a href="#quarter">see
below</a>). The last three parts are the same, which aids the
conductor. There are no more than 4 bobs in a row, apart from one
run of 9. This is of great musical benefit, as it avoids the
monotony of the same pair of bells dodging behind for long
periods.</p>

<p>The average number of bobs per run is less than 2, which is
lower than for any twin-bob composition. Bells quite often go up
to the back and are unaffected by the bobs before returning,
which is preferable to having so many bobs that bells are always
affected when behind. There are not many runs of an odd number of
bobs (of more than one) which helps in working out which way to
go in.</p>

<p>Easier compositions tend to be made up of identical parts with
part-ends as members of a group. A group is a set of
transformations of the order of bells such that if any two
transformations are combined the result is also in the set. The
simplest group is the cyclic group, for example the rotations of
rounds on 5 which is equivalent to rotations of a pentagon. Brian
Price has been using various <a
href="https://ringing.info/bdp/peals-in-parts/parts-0.html">
groups</a> for Stedman compositions for some years, and Hudson's
60 courses are a group. Nigel Newton reported that he had
investigated the dihedral group D5 (rotations and reflections of
a pentagon) and had produced five mutually true round blocks, the
crucial odd number for a bobs-only composition, but could not
link them into a peal.</p>

<p>I investigated cyclic groups of order 5 or 7, and found
several touches, but none long enough to divide the extent into 5
or 7 blocks. I also investigated D5, which was much easier to
search as it divides the extent into 10 shorter blocks, of only
504 changes. I found many blocks of 504 changes, but only one
linked to the start of another block and so was remotely useful.
These blocks happen to join in pairs to form 5 round blocks of
1,008 changes. Unfortunately the Q-sets (where three bobs can be
changed into three plains, or vice versa) present do not allow
the blocks to be linked. Other linkages such as pairs of bobs did
not seem to help. I think I have shown that there is only one
such block (with its rotations and reversals) using D5. Using 10
singles in total this block can be arranged to give a perfect
five-part peal.</p>

<p>I noticed that the sixes ending 67 and 76 occurred in the same
place in each part as they were the fixed bells at the part-end.
If a block could be found without 67 at a six-end, then in the 10
blocks 67 would never occur at a six-end, and 67 would never
occur behind at backstroke. These missing 20 sixes could then be
arranged into two bobbed blocks, which would still leave an odd
number of blocks in total. Similarly sixes ending in 76 could be
excluded from the main block, and included as bobbed blocks.</p>

<p>Block <tt><a href="#blockB">B</a></tt>
is such a block of 492 changes, excluding the
two sixes with 76 behind, with a suitable part-end to link in
pairs to give 5 mutually true round blocks of 984 changes. There
are then two bobbed blocks of 60 changes with 76 behind,
containing the other changes in the peal. These bobbed blocks can
be chosen as one of six possible complementary pairs, and with a
suitable choice enough Q-sets are available to link the seven
blocks together. There are 
<a href="https://complib.org/collection/11309/?chapter=10-part">
four basic arrangements</a> of the peal.
The Q-set linkages were chosen to minimise the number of bobs
(438 rather than 441), the appropriate reversal of the whole peal
was chosen to give cyclic part-ends and the order of the parts
and start was chosen to give 3 identical parts at the end and all
the "reverse rounds" part-ends in the first half of the peal.</p>

<p><a id="quarter" name="quarter"></a>The blocks can also be
arranged into a quarter peal, which might be useful to give a
conductor some practice. For example, calling 
<tt><a href="#blockE">E</a><a href="#blockE">E</a><a href="#blockC">C</a></tt>
gives a <a href="https://complib.org/composition/101775">
touch of 1,308 changes</a>.</p>

<p>Block <tt><a href="#blockB">B</a></tt>
was discovered using a computer program
written in 'C', capable of processing about 500,000 sixes per
second of the graph linking sixes together. This search detected
falseness against sixes in other parts and against sixes with the
front three bells in another order. A complete search of a group
D5 takes about 6 hours on an <a
href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a> 486/50MHz machine. By
running the program under the OS/2 multi-tasking operating system
this can go on in the background without interfering with normal
operation of the computer. Searching for Q-sets, proving peals
and formatting data was done using utility programs written in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx">REXX</a>, making use of
content-addressable arrays and the translate function for easy
transposition.</p>

<p>Other simpler peals might be possible. A perfect five-part
would be nice, though unless it had some ten-part type structure
it may not be any easier to learn. Other irregular ten-part peals
could have 67 and 76 both excluded from the main block, but might
result in more complex linkages of the blocks. 
Block <tt><a href="#blockB">B</a></tt>
has the advantage of at most 4 bobs in a row, and the course
omitted or repeated in other parts is only 12 sixes long, making
the parts quite similar, which might not be the case with another
block. A perfect seven-part, though an attractive concept, is
probably not a conductor's first choice as there are no fixed
bells to call it from. There are probably other peals out there
&mdash; whether they are any simpler to call is an open
question.</p>
